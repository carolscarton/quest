prostate cancer screening : take the test or not ?
indeed , the psa test sometimes shows erroneous results with false negative or even false positive results , which involve unnecessary medical interventions .
enough to make already reluctant men hesitate to take screening tests .
take the test or not ?
we asked two specialists for their opinion .
in studies conducted in the united states , there was a lot of contamination between control groups , so it is difficult to interpret the data and make firm recommendations .
another study , this time a european one , concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who were screened and those who were not .
this study also showed , with a follow- up after 12 years , that it is between 30 and 40 % more likely for metastases to occur in the absence of screening .
i therefore recommend the test from age 50 , or 40 if you have a direct relative who previously had prostate cancer .
african - american men are also more at risk .
the key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected .
there are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent .
the patient really needs to be made to understand the degree of risk of his cancer , by offering him the options available , not necessarily treating prostate cancers that are not long- term life threatening , and opting instead , in such cases , for active monitoring of the disease .
today , many men in whom cancer has been detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life threatening .
active monitoring will be suggested , and if the disease progresses , they will be offered treatment .
more and more , specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who should or should not be treated .
therefore i recommend taking the test .
but the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not to take it .
in collaboration with the société internationale d 'urologie [ siu ] , movember has created a tool that makes it possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the psa test .

preventing the disease
unfortunately , there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer .
despite the progress in research , the adoption of healthy living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it .
it is estimated that if everyone ate well and exercised enough , 30 % of cancers could be prevented .
" if no more people smoked , this rate would increase to at least 50 % , " says andré beaulieu , spokesman for the canadian cancer society .
on the other hand , it is estimated that roughly 10 % of cancers are hereditary .
some are also completely unexplained .
for the canadian cancer society , the fight against tobacco remains a priority , despite the decrease in the number of smokers .
cigarettes are linked to 85 % of lung cancer cases .
it is also a risk factor for a number of others .
this massively damages people 's health .
" even today , there are 1.5 million smokers in quebec " deplores spokesperson andré beaulieu .
encouraging data : 10 years after giving up smoking , the risk of dying from cancer drops by half .
weight
overweight and obesity are also conducive to the onset of the disease , according to the scc .
they can increase the risks of cancer of the breast , colon and rectum , oesophagus , pancreas and uterus .
" research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout your life protects against colon cancer " it is also said .
diet
the organisation also recommends limiting your consumption of red meat .
in large amounts , it increases the risks of developing colo- rectal cancer .
likewise , so do cured meat products , and these should be avoided .
the conservation of meat by smoking , drying or curing can cause the formation of carcinogens .
" they can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer " it is explained .
vitamins
in recent years , a number of scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer .
for the time being however their research is inconclusive .
studies on vitamin e are contradictory , according to the scc .
while one study noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer , another noted an increase .
also the effect of vitamin d on cancer is not clear .
in addition , mr beaulieu emphasises the importance of discussing your concerns and family history with your doctor .
" taking a screening test doesn 't give you cancer . "
