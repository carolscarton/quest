a republican strategy to counter the re- election of obama
republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud .
however , the brennan centre considers this a myth , stating that electoral fraud is rarer in the united states than the number of people killed by lightning .
indeed , republican lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the united states in a decade .
one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turn- out .
in this sense , the measures will partially undermine the american democratic system .
unlike in canada , the american states are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the united states .
it is in this spirit that a majority of american governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult .
this phenomenon gained momentum following the november 2010 elections , which saw 675 new republican representatives added in 26 states .
as a result , 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone .
the new election laws require voters to show a photo id card and proof of us citizenship .
furthermore , these laws also reduce early voting periods , invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record .
before the 2006 elections , no us state required voters to show a photo id card .
indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement .
in 2008 , the supreme court of the united states upheld the constitutionality of the indiana law .
the republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other states .
over the past two years , they sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to show a photo id card .
it is important to note that , unlike quebec , american citizens do not have a universal id card such as the health insurance card .
in fact , 11 % of american citizens , i.e. 21 million people of voting age , do not possess a photo id card issued by a government agency of their state .
in addition , five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification .
and it often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card .
the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people , minorities and people with low incomes .
in fact , 25 % of african americans , 15 % of those earning less than $ 35,000 ; 18 % of citizens over 65 and 20 % of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the required photo id card .
and that 's not all .
students , voters considered to be voting more for democratic candidates , are not allowed in several states to use the photo id card issued by their institution .
on the other hand , these same states allow fishing or hunting club members , who vote more republican , to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote .
prior to 2004 , no state required proof of citizenship to vote .
arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement .
since 2011 , a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are american citizens .
these measures are clearly intended to limit the hispanic vote .
however , it appears that two out of three hispanic voters favour the democratic party .
what is more , in 2011 republican legislators sponsored laws abolishing the registration of voters on election day in eight states .
in addition , they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register .
these restrictions are not without consequence .
for example , during the 2004 general election , voter registration campaigns contributed to registering around 10 million citizens .
however , the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17 % drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 .
in addition , republican legislators have enacted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the early voting period .
for example , during the 2008 general election in florida , 33 % of early voters were african - americans , who accounted however for only 13 % of voters in the state .
the same applied to hispanics .
these represented only 11 % of voters , but 24 % of citizens who voted early .
on the other hand , 76 % of voters were white but these represented only 46 % of early voters .
of course , democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration .
several bills were blocked by vetoes of democratic governors .
the united states attorney general intervened to suspend the most controversial laws .
they were able to partially limit the damage .
for example , only 16 out of 34 states have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo id card .
however , the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012 .
democratic critics denounce the partisan character of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective of influencing the 2012 results in key states .
a 2011 brennan centre report shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidency .
it is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections .
but one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turn- out .
in this sense , the measures will partially undermine the american democratic system .
